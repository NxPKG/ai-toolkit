# AI TOOLKIT Core

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced programs that can understand, create, and engage with human language on a large scale.
They are trained on vast amounts of written material to recognize patterns in language and predict what might come next in a given piece of text.

AI TOOLKIT Core **simplifies working with LLMs by offering a standardized way of integrating them into your app** - so you can focus on building great AI applications for your users, not waste time on technical details.

For example, hereâ€™s how you can generate text with various models using the AI TOOLKIT:

## AI TOOLKIT Core Functions

AI TOOLKIT Core has various functions designed for [text generation](./generating-text), [structured data generation](./generating-structured-data), and [tool usage](./tools-and-tool-calling).
These functions take a standardized approach to setting up [prompts](./prompts) and [settings](./settings), making it easier to work with different models.

- [`generateText`](/docs/ai-toolkit-core/generating-text): Generates text and [tool calls](./tools-and-tool-calling).
  This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases such as automation tasks where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.
- [`streamText`](/docs/ai-toolkit-core/generating-text): Stream text and tool calls.
  You can use the `streamText` function for interactive use cases such as [chat bots](/docs/ai-toolkit-ui/chatbot) and [content streaming](/docs/ai-toolkit-ui/completion).
- [`generateObject`](/docs/ai-toolkit-core/generating-structured-data): Generates a typed, structured object that matches a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema.
  You can use this function to force the language model to return structured data, e.g. for information extraction, synthetic data generation, or classification tasks.
- [`streamObject`](/docs/ai-toolkit-core/generating-structured-data): Stream a structured object that matches a Zod schema.
  You can use this function to [stream generated UIs](/docs/ai-toolkit-ui/object-generation).

## API Reference

Please check out the [AI TOOLKIT Core API Reference](/docs/reference/ai-toolkit-core) for more details on each function.
