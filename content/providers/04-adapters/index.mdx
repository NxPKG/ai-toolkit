# Adapters

Adapters are lightweight integrations that enable you to use
the AI TOOLKIT UI functions (`useChat` and `useCompletion`)
with 3rd party libraries.

The following adapters are currently available:

- [LangChain](/providers/adapters/langchain)
- [LlamaIndex](/providers/adapters/llamaindex)
